The Goatfell Race is a classic with a bit of everything: road, trail, rough hill track, and scrambling up steep granite boulders to reach the dramatic summit. Then a tricky descent and fast run off to return the same way back to Brodick.

NOTE: The 2007 route was about 2 miles shorter, and missed out the road section from Brodick
