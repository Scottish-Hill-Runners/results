Senior Race (see revision on map)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: due to tree damage and new mountain biking routes
I have decided that the direct ascent up Pitfichie hill is no longer
possible. For 2023 we will instead ascend via the track running
between the two hills and do a short loop up to the summit of
Pitfichie. The rest of the route will remain unchanged except for some
minor diversions when entering the forest after the descent off Cairn
William. This is the same route as we ran in 2022 and will be clearly
marked and marshalled. Registration from 2.00 pm at Monymusk Village
Hall Entries (pay on day), Â£5. Entries will be accepted on the
day. However, it is helpful for smooth running on race day if you are
able to register in advance.

Tree diseases and pests are posing an increasing threat to our forests
and can be spread very quickly from forest to forest on muddy tyres,
boots or paws. We believe everyone who loves spending time in the
forest will want to help if they can to reduce the risk of spread of
disease. For some simple ways everyone can help follow the link to
