June 17th 2017 sees the 2nd year of this exciting hill running relay event. Although still concentrated on the scenic Ochil Hills surrounding the spectacular Alva Glen, the routes have been altered from last year.

Again, the relay comprises of three legs (each of which will be run by a separate competitor) with each changeover taking place in the Johnstone park, giving spectators and competitors an exciting view of their team's progress.

The first leg is a 6.0km run, running into the picturesque Alva Glen, then around and back over The Nebit before returning to the Johnstone Park. There are 2 checkpoints to negotiate on this leg.

The second leg is the longest leg at 7.5km with a formidable and steep climb up Torry. Competitors will run over Midhill, descend into the depths of Alva Glen, then onto The Nebit before returning to the Johnstone park. There are 4 checkpoints en route.

The 3rd leg, the shortest at 4.75km, has runners heading through the length of Alva Glen to the 'Smugglers Cave' viewpoint, before running up a steep [ascent](http://www.simplesite.com/builder/pages/editpagecontent.aspx?pageid=424659900#93488541 "Click to Continue > by Advertise") of the east gully of Torry, passing 2 checkpoints en route and back to finish at the Johnstone Park.
