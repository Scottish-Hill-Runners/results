A popular race on a popular hill. The biggest dangers are colliding with hill walkers and tripping on the stony descent. This race has a high casualty rate, with bloodied knees and several broken ankles in recent years. That said, it's a great race with distinct sections of forest trail (largely felled now), open hill, plateau, summit dome, and narrow summit ridge.
