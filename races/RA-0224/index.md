Registration at Achnacarry hall NN175879 where the race finishes.

The race starts at the magnificent Eas Chia-aig waterfall and enters the Mile Dorcha (Dark Mile), before branching off onto the forestry track and then following a rough path to Fedden (ruin).

After the ruin head straight up to Sron a Choire Gairbh, then steeply down south to the col before climbing to Meall na Teanga and on to Meall Coire Lochain (a short fine scrambly ridge), before a smooth flat and fast descent from the summit to steep grass above the forest.

Return to the northernmost edge of forest and reverse the outward approach until a steep single track leads back to Eas Chia-aig waterfall. Then enjoy a final sprint to the road bridge by the hall on Achnacarry estate for tea and cakes.
