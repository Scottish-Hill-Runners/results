Third race in Deeside’s notorious Night Race Series. Prizes galore
(don’t do it for the prizes), cafes serving well-earned refreshments
after (bring some money)… what’s not to like?

moorland in the area of Dess Woods, situated between Kincardine O’Neil
and Aboyne (OS: 37, GR: NJ 57 00). Full waterproof body cover, map,
compass and head torch required. Prize-giving and post-race soup,
sandwiches etc. available for purchase, at Activity Park.
