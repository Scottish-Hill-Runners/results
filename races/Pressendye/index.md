Up and back by the same route, it’s a tough climb but the paths are
good so it is a fast race. The route will be marked. Great views of
Deeside for those in less of a hurry. There are three nearby car
parks: in the woods opposite the road to the start (car park 1 on the
map), in the estate yard on the left just down this road (car park 2
on the map), and by the estate offices (car park 3 on the map). Please
only use this one if the others are full. If all three are full park
in the village.

If you think you will be coming to the race it would be very helpful
if you could register in advance. This is free and does not imply
any commitment, but will speed up the registration process. Pay when
you collect your number.  Junior 5km race.

Parking in nearby estate car park or by roadside.

Entry Fee £2.50

Start Time 19:30.
