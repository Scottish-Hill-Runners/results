This is the first race in the Scottish Hill Runners Bog and Burn
series and is sponsored by North Ayrshire Athletics Club [NAAC].

Entry on-line, via [Entry Central](https://www.entrycentral.com/kaim-hill-race).

Race registration will be at Fairlie Parish Church, KA29 0AL and is
approx a 7 minute walk to the start.

Race briefing at 6:50pm at start line and will be run under SHR rules
which means waterproof full body cover, hat, gloves and a whistle.

The race starts at 7pm with a short section of tarmac before heading
up the Fairlie Glen, a scenic narrow winding trail with lots of tree
roots and uneven path underfoot to keep you alert. After reaching the
kissing gate at the top of the glen there's a tricky burn crossing to
contend with, before a climb up a steep muddy bank gains you access to
the open hillside covered with rough heather and grassy tussocks. The
route then follows a quad bike track towards the summit plateau in an
anti-clockwise direction to the cairn. At the turn the descent takes
you through a bog and back down the same route to the welcoming
finishing line. Caution required on the descent through the glen due
to the many tree roots and protruding rocks.

Prizegiving, a hot drink (if you can bring your own cup that would be
great) and cake will be provided back at the Fairlie Parish
Church. Please ensure you remove any dirty footwear before entering
the church hall.
