**Runners must carry map of the route, compass, whistle and full waterproof body cover.**

Note that the race is Entry On The Day and there is no pre-entry online to bother about

The highlight of this race is the section of man-eating emerald green bog between Cort-ma Law and Lecket Hill (the highest point on the route).

After Lecket there is an exciting tussocky descent to a tricky double burn crossing, before a steep climb back up the fenceline (**do not cross the fence**) to re-join the outward route at the broken stile, where there will be a marshal.
