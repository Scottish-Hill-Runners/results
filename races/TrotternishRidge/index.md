Quiraing and there are few paths. The race is over rough and steep
terrain. Runners are expected to make their own way between six
checkpoints, therefore runners must be competent with map and compass.

The exact grid references for checkpoints will be released closer to
the race, as they are subject to SNH conditions.

All competitors will be transferred to start of race from Portree and
back from finish by courtesy coach.

All runners must have completed two AM races or have relevant
experience.

Portree on the evening of the race.
