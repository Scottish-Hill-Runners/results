Entries from 6pm-6.30pm at the entrance to the glen. Entries close 6.30pm sharp to allow time to get to the summit. Over 16s only

Some parking available at Alva Glen. Additional overflow parking available at Ochils Leisure Centre (see map above)

Start is staggered at 15 sec intervals from top of summit cairn

There will be 3 compulsory checkpoints on the route:  
• CP1: at the land-rover track crossing  
• CP2: at the bend in the land-rover track  
• CP3 Gate at the entrance to the glen

After registering you will be expected to make your own way to the start line on the summit of The Nebit. You will be called to start at your allotted time. Please ensure that your race number can be easily seen when you approach and cross the finish line.

Retirement – If you decide to retire from the race at any time after registering, you must inform the race organiser or race official at the finish. There will be basic first aid available at the finish.

Clothing – You should take clothing appropriate for the prevailing weather conditions. Bear in mind that you may be required to wait \[for up to 30 mins\] on an exposed hilltop before starting your descent. You must wear appropriate footwear for the ground conditions on the day.

Terrain - You must be capable of running fast over rough ground. The route will be flagged from CP1 to CP2 and from CP3 to the finish. There are small crags between checkpoints 1 and 2, so you must stick to the flagged route for this section. Remember to duck as you run under the water pipe when you re-enter the glen!

Navigation – You must be able to find you way between the checkpoints, particularly for the sections where there are no flag markings. This should not normally be too difficult but it could require navigation with map and compass if visibility is low.

Collisions – Remember that the race route is open to people not connected with the race. Please be courteous to each other and anyone else you may meet.

Prize-giving will be held immediately after the race at the finish
