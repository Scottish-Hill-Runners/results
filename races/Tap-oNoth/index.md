The race will start at the playing fields in the centre of Rhynie.
Ample parking can be found on the streets around Rhynie with only a
short walk to the start/registration.

The route has been amended to avoid the road as best possible. Runners
will take a right into fields just out of Rhynie, once through the
fields its up through the heather to the trig point at the top same a
usual.  Route will be marked accordingly and marshals at various
points. Follow the same route back down however just as you get into
Rhynie you cut straight across the road, then take a left and come
into the playing fields from the opposite side (same finish as
normal).  Junior route will be the same but runners will loop back
around at approximately 2.5km.
