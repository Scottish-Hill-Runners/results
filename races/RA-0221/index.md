A short race with a bit of everything. The route is well marked. From the playing fields, run up through ferns, across a stile, and into forest. Uphill, a sharp turn and you're out of the forest, through more ferns and onto grass covered open hillside. A couple of short steep pulls then 3 cairns are run around, before being directed downhill. Some slippy, tussocky ground and some rocky sections to try and avoid, then rejoin the path for a very quick descent.

**Note that the race starts at 2:30pm**
