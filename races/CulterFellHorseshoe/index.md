Last organised in 2005, when it was a British Championship counter.

Entry Fee: £10 (please make cheques payable to "Save The Crook") All pre entries will receive a WINDSTOPPER® beanie. These cost more than the entry itself. So grab yourself a bargain & come and run a course that's not been available since 2005.

Note: All proceeds will go towards "Save The Crook" appeal [http://www.savethecrook.org.uk/](http://www.savethecrook.org.uk/ )

The landowners have said they will see how this years race goes, with a view to me hopefully being able to reinstate it again as an annual race if all goes well. So please come and support us and lets show them how good the fell running community is.
