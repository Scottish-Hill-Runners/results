The race begins with a full lap of the games field before heading towards the hill via an obstacle course of 2 barriers, a lumpy field full of thistles, 2 more fences, a river, some rounded boulders, a very steep bank, another fence right next to a crash barrier, across a road and then you can finally start running properly.

The race proper after the initial scramble starts with a wide gravel track leading towards the birch woods of Coille na Creige Duibhe, where a narrow path leads through grass, and rising to a narrower rockier trail through heather to the fine perched summit of An Torr.

The descent is fast and exciting down heather initially and then back down the narrow trail with little chance of overtaking until lower down. Then after the road crossing the same crazy obstacle course of 5 fences plus a river to cross, before a final lap of the games field to finish.
