There is ample free car parking in the main village car park where there are also toilets. The start is about 200 metres away in Glen Luss to the west of the A82. As there are sheep on the hillside and it is lambing time, **no dogs** are to be taken on the open hill.

**Full body cover to be worn or carried.** There will be a kit check before the start.
