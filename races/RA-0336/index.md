Registration will be at the Loch Lomond Arms Hotel, G83 8NY

Registration opens at 10:30am

Runners must be 18 or over. Full body cover, whistle, map & compass must be carried, and will be checked at race registration. Navigational experience and skills will be required.

The route will initially climb Beinn Dubh 642m before running along the ridge to the higher Beinn Dubh summit 657m. Runners will then descend to Mid Hill and continue descending to a checkpoint about half way down the ridge. The route then heads steeply down hill to a checkpoint at a river bend. Runners are then faced with a sting in the tail back to the summit of Beinn Dubh 642m and a fast decent back down the track they climbed at the start.

A short course will also be available which will be an out and back to checkpoint 1 at the summit of Beinn Dubh.
