The race was resumed in 2017 after a break of 25 years. The route
starts from the car park at Huntly Auction Mart, following the minor
road upwards until it meets the path that meanders to the trig point
at the top of the hill. The runners then take the same route back down
to the finish line at the Mart.

Entry: Â£7.00 (includes Cuppa & Bacon roll)

Entry will be via Entry Central & limited on the day entries (we never turn any runner away!)
