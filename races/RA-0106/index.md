An out and back to the summit of The Scrape above the tranquil Manor Valley. Traditionally the first of a 2-race series paired with Pentland Skyline, known as the "Man or Mouse". The race changed in 2004 to a slightly shorter route starting from the fields near Woodhouse Farm, allowing easier access to the hill. The route is almost entirely runnable apart from the last steep climb to The Scrape, which reduces most runners to a walk. After the race you can take advantage of the refreshments tent, and enjoy watching the Manor Water Sheepdog Trials.
