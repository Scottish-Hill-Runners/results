A hill race across two Munro summits in the Western Mamores, Glen
Nevis; Mullach nan Coirean and Stob Ban.

Approx 13km w/ 1300m of ascent, this will be an unmarked course over
steep and rough terrain, with particular care needed on several
sections.

Full body waterproof cover, hat, gloves, map, compass and whistle will
be required, with no exceptions. As the race will be held early in the
season, runners are asked to think carefully about clothing and kit on
the day, and extra kit requirements may be enforced.

The race will be held under Scottish Hill Runners rules.
