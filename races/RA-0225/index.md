The 21st Mountain Navigation Challenge will take place in the Manor Hills in the south of Scotland on July 18/19th 2009.

The Mountain Navigation Challenge is a two-day mountain marathon type score event for teams of two people traditionally held in, or near, the Lake District. However, the 19th MNC saw its first venture North of the Border to the Moffat Hills, and this year it is remaining in the south of Scotland for the third year, but moving to the Manor Hills. The time limits are seven hours on day one and five hours on day two, during which teams visit as many controls as they can. Teams must carry all the equipment and food they require for two days and one night on the fells. The maximum number of teams is only 20 and the event has a history of being fun and friendly and yet retaining the element of competition.

The 21st MNC will start from [St Mary’s Hall at Cappercleuch](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=324350&Y=623150&A=Y&Z=120), on the shores of St Mary’s Loch. This is on the A708 between Moffat and Selkirk at [NT243231](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=324350&Y=623150&A=Y&Z=130). It's about 50 miles from Carlisle. There will be a staggered start from 11 am on Saturday 18th July, registration and control details from 9.30 am. We aim to be finished by 2pm on the Sunday to allow for travelling home.

Teams must be competent with a map and compass, have experience of navigation on the fells in poor visibility, be physically fit and take full responsibility for their own safety and for the consequences of their own actions while participating in the event. Tradition has it that the winning team has the honour of organising the Mountain Navigation Challenge for the following year. You have been warned!
