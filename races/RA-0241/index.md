Deeside Runners are organising a mountain bike/ hill running duathlon on Sunday the 13th September, starting at 12 noon. The race will consist of the following:*   Run 1: 7.5km, 420m climb.
*   Bike: 21km, 650m climb.
*   Run 2: 3.2km, 215m climb
    
    The race can be run as an individual, or in teams of 2. The runs are real hill runs, ie steep in parts with some heather. They will be mostly unmarked, so it will be useful to carry and be able to read a map. The bike ride is not very technical, but it will be an advantage to have some ability on rough tracks. Full suspension is not necessary, though it might be more comfortable. The route is all off-road, so there will be no traffic. There may be walkers on parts of it however.
