The race starts with straightforward forest track running, before rougher ground that leads to a steep descent into Glen Ample.

Once across Glen Ample you've finally reached the base of the hill proper. A steep heathery slog up Beinn Each then gets you onto the start of the fantastic undulating ridge out to Stuc a\`Chroin and back.

The crux of the route is the climb back out of Glen Ample on the return leg, and then you've still got a deceptively long run out along the forest tracks.

Very well supported race, with countless water stations, and flagged all the way to the summit and back.
