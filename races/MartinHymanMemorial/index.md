Over 50 years ago Martin Hyman established a small fund to support
Elite British Foot Orienteers. Members of the British Squad have
raised money for this fund in many ways over the years. All recipients
are asked to do something to help swell the coffers. Every year
applicants are invited to submit their future costed plans with the
reason why this training will help them improve, supported by their
coach. Over 500 athletes have been helped by the Fund and if in
Martin's memory you would like to donate to it please do.
