Traprain Law is a typical Lothian volcanic hill rising from the
fertile East Lothian agricultural lowlands. For the geologist, it’s
laccolith of Phonolitic trachyte (a kind of volcanic boil which didn’t
quite burst). For the archaeologist it was the stronghold of the
Votadini tribe who lived up there and were in peaceful coexistence
with the local Romans most of the time. The Traprain Treasure (a hoard
of Roman silver), which was found on the Law, can be seen in the Royal
Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. The race passes close to the
still-visible site of discovery. More recently, the East Linton
Village Gala Committee decided in the 70’s that a race to the top from
the village would be an entertaining event. The race has since become
an regular feature of the village Gala. Carnethy Hill Running Club
became the host club and organisers in the late 80’s. The race follows
the riverside footpath and farm tracks to the foot of the Law. The
ascent is a steep rock scramble up the east ridge on the edge of the
old quarry followed by a fast grassy descent back to farm tracks and
the riverside path. The outgoing route involves a wade across the
River Tyne which is usually no more than a welcome cooling but
sometimes becomes a raging torrent forcing a course detour by the
footbridge.
