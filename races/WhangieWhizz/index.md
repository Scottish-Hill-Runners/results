**Race Kit Requirements**: You must have the following minimum kit with
you at all times during the race: waterproof jacket with hood,
waterproof over trousers, hat, gloves, whistle. This is the minimum
kit requirement for this event, but you are responsible for carrying
any additional items you consider necessary for your own protection
given the conditions, or as the race organiser may dictate on the
day. Failure to comply will mean automatic disqualification from the
event. All of the above is for your own safety – hypothermia can be
fatal.
