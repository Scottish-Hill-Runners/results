• Run 14.3km with ascent of 471m  
• Cycle 24.1km with ascent of 538m

This will be the 12th Applecross Duathlon. In addition to the race there is the "Challenge" (Fun Run or Walk) starting an hour earlier (12:30pm). The course is both testing and wildly beautiful. The run follows the ancient right of way from Applecross Bay to the north coast of the peninsular, near Kenmore and the cycle then goes round the coast road, alongside the Inner Sound, with stunning views of the Skye Cuillin, before finishing at the award winning Applecross Inn. Tea and prize giving follow in the Community Hall. And yet, the Entry Fee is just £6.

In the words of one former winner:

_"I can honestly say it is one of the most enjoyable events in the country... a winning formula in one of the best parts of Scotland"_
