Pre-enter via [**Si Entries**](https://www.sientries.co.uk/event.php?beid=Y&event_id=1048), or cycle to the race for free entry on the night.

Fast running on tracks and footpaths, with one climb up Hare Hill, and steep descent to Greencleuch. Note: the climb up Hare Hill and descent to Greencleuch is the same as for the Pentland skyline route, but rather than climbing Black Hill, the race follows the contouring foot path to West of Black Hill to cross the causeway and return round back of Threipmuir reservoir to finish at Red Moss Car park.
