The route starts with an initial climb out of Alva Glen, followed by fast runnable trail through Woodland Park to reach Tillicoultry. From Tillicoultry there's a steep climb to reach the approach path to King's Seat. At grid ref 927001 the route turns left along a fenceline to join the Maddy Moss route in reverse to the highpoint of Ben Cleuch. After Ben Cleuch there is a small rise over Ben Ever before a fast and furious descent back to Alva.
