**General Information**

The Highlander Mountain Marathon 2015 will take place on Saturday and Sunday 25th/26th April.

The Highlander shares a number of similarities with many other Mountain Marathons but it also has it’s own unique character. To start with, the scale of the event means we are able to gain access to some of the most dramatic and unspoilt areas that the north of Scotland has to offer such as Torridon, Dundonnell and Strathfarrar, we also favour wee quirks that make taking part in the Highlander a memorable experience and then there’s the Scottish Ceilidh. In order to keep this unique feel we are capping entries to 300 pairs across all courses.

But don’t be fooled in to thinking the Highlander is a soft option, our courses are at least as demanding as their counterparts in comparable events we just don’t see the point in making competitors spend any longer than necessary in cramped tents. There are always stories to be shared, friends to catch up with and reels to be danced before turning in reasonably early in anticipation of a challenging second day. Every year as the event comes to an end we think “ We’ll never top this . . . “, but the following year we always do – see you in April 2015!

The location will be announced on 25th March 2015 – 1 month prior to the event. The location will be no further than 1.5 hours drive from Inverness.
