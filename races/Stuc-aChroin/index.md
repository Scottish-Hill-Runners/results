One of the first Category AL races in the calendar, and called the
Stuc a' Chroin 5000 because of its approximate total climb (in feet!),
the race is 20k long with a 1500+m ascent.

A hill race run annually since 1989, the race covers Ben Each and Stuc
a’ Chroin peaks amidst the stunning Loch Lomond and Trossachs National
Park.

We are supported by the many marshals, supporters and sponsors over
the many years who have given their time and resources to help us
making this one of the most popular races in the calendar.

Bar and a free ceilidh in the evening.

**New start/finish location, and new route through forest since 2015**

The race starts with straightforward forest track running, before
rougher ground that leads to a steep descent into Glen Ample.

Once across Glen Ample you've finally reached the base of the hill
proper. A steep heathery slog up Beinn Each then gets you onto the
start of the fantastic undulating ridge out to Stuc a\`Chroin and
back.

The crux of the route is the climb back out of Glen Ample on the
return leg, and then you've still got a deceptively long run out along
the forest tracks.

Very well supported race, with countless water stations, and flagged
all the way to the summit and back.
