Beautiful setting at the head of Glenholm.

This race marks the transition from winter to spring, and conditions can vary from snow cover to spring sunshine.

The route must pack in the most amount of climbing for any race so short. A relentlessly steep climb followed immediately by a thigh-burning descent.
