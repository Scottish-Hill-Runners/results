[![Race Profile](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/BenRinnesProfile_tn.jpg)](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/BenRinnesProfile.jpg) Highland Games Race at Dufftown - the whisky capital of Scotland. Fantastic atmosphere with piped bands and caber tossing. The route is an out and back to Ben Rinnes, the dominant hill of the region, passing the rounded summits of Little Conval and Meikle Conval on the outward and return journeys. The most straightforward and runnable of the long Scottish hill races. Good terrain and easy route-finding most of the way. The only rough heathery section is between Meikle Conval and the road crossing. The race starts and finishes with a lap of the grassy sports track, which thankfully is much shorter than the track for Ben Nevis.
