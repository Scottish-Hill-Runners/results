The race follows runnable grassy ridges and tracks. There is one
thigh-burning steep descent just before the first road crossing. Then
around the back of Steygail is pretty fast and runnable, with a
steepish climb and drop over a col. After the 2nd road crossing the
route climbs into a shallow valley that leads to a steep climb up Well
Hill. After Well Hill there is one more climb to return to Black Hill
before a fast runnable descent to the finish.
