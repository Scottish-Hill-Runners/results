The symbol of the heart is often used to represent love and Fell is an
old word to describe high moorland, which is typical to South West
Scotland, hence the name could also mean 'Love the high moorlands'.

The entry fee is £8 with all profits going to Moffat Mountain Rescue
Team. Register at Entry Central: https://www.entrycentral.com/
