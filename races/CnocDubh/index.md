The race starts and finishes at Cambus O’May forestry car park, on
north side of the A93 mid way between Dinnet and Ballater. The route
is all on paths in the forest, and will be marked. The paths are
generally good and make for very pleasant running. Runners will be
required to have a good headtorch, and to carry full body cover, a map
and compass (just in case they got lost in the woods at night in the
middle of winter). A spare torch is also a really good idea.
