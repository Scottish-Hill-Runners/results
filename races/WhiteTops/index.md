The White Tops Hill race usually takes place on a Friday evening in
June . Registration is at Kirkton of Auchterhouse Village School and
the race starts in the nearby playing field.

The race covers 10.4km with a height gain of 360m. Anyone over the age
of 17 can take part and the course will be well marked and marshalled,
making it suitable for hill racing beginners.

We have been given the original trophies for this race from Dundee
Road Runners, so if you want something nice for your trophy cabinet
and see your name along with the likes of Joe Symonds, Dan
Whitehead, Oleg Chepelin, Jamie Crowe, Angela Mudge etc., why not come
and try to beat the rest!
