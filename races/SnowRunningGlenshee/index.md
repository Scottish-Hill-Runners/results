A winter hill running event hosted at Glenshee Ski Centre with two
loops to choose from.

With the course being held here at Glenshee Ski Centre, it can
certainly offer challenging conditions but the weather will be closely
monitored to ensure it will be a safe event.

The experience of running in the snow at night in the Scottish
mountains makes Snow Running a unique event in the UK Hill Running
Calendar.

Format: Hill running circuit around Glenshee Ski Station on the
compact piste snow, run at sunset and into the winter night. Short
(6.5km) and long (11.5km) courses for range of abilities.

Designed as a challenging but fun event. You can run it as an
opportunity to simply experience the challenge of the snowy hills at
night or as a fierce mountain competitor chasing the trophy!

Participants must have done sufficient training and have an optimal
level of health and physical condition, plus experience of undertaking
activities in mountain conditions.
