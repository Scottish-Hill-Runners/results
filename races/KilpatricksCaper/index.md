**New race route for 2018 due to forestry operations**

Please note the following points from the Race Organiser:

* The Forestry Commission car park by the gasworks is currently
  closed. Could competitors please park at Clydebank Crematorium,
  which is c10 mins walk from the start/finish. Or, better yet,
  Kilpatrick train station is 5 mins walk from the start line!
* Due to lambing the route has been changed slightly, runners will now
  descend directly from the Slacks trig point to the cattle-grid on
  the road. Please see map below.
* Depending on the weather, full race kit may be required: No Kit = No
  Race!
* Unfortunately there will be no toilets at the start of the race. 
* Entry is Â£5, cash only.
