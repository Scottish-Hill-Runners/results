The North Berwick Law Race dates back to the 1950's and was organised
by Edinburgh AC for 60 years until its last running in 2019. It was
one of the oldest and most popular hill races in Scotland which
attracted a large field of elite, club runners, locals and tourists.

Earlier this year Team East Lothian AC and a community group of local
runners and volunteers took over the organisation of the race to
ensure its long term future. Having now received all the necessary
permissions we are delighted to announce that the race will return
this year on Wednesday 2 August at 7.30pm.

The course is 5km long with 187m climb. The start and finish is at
North Berwick Harbour.

Please note: We only have permission to hold the race if we follow a
route on the Law defined by the countryside ranger service.  Due to
erosion the route on the Law will be fully marked and must be
followed. You cannot choose your own route up or down.
