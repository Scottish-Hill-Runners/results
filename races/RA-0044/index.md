**Craighouse to Gleann Astaile**  
Start at the Distillery. Turn left immediately up steep track, through deer-fence gate and along right edge of forest plantation. Very boggy. Then gradually upwards through rough terrain to Dubh Bheinn. Turn sharp right at the summit and descend complex ridge passing several lochans, before steep rocky climb to summit of Glas Bheinn. Traverse west along the ridge to Aonach Bheinn. Steep rocky heathery descent to Gleann Astaile.

**Gleann Astaile to Beinn Shiantaidh**  
Straight up Beinn a’Chaolais, at first following a small burn (take a good drink here), but then moving leftwards up bands of heather and weaving back rightwards higher up to miss the worst of the boulder fields. Steep descent off Beinn a’Chaolais on angular scree and boulders to the bealach, then straight up obvious ridge to the summit of Beinn an Oir, moving leftwards near the top to avoid large boulder field. Descend Beinn an Oir NE along boulder-marked track until small ruin, then turn sharp right down steep grass. Keep to the right for as long as possible before cutting down left through rocks and heather to reach the bealach. The ascent of Beinn Shiantaidh is steep but straightfoward.  
  
**Beinn Shiantaidh to Corra Bheinn**  
Descend E ridge on mainly small scree and patches of vegetation, until it's possible to veer left and aim for the lochans, and the straightforward climb up Corra Bheinn.  
  
**Corra Bheinn to Craighouse**  
Take care with the bearing off Corra Bheinn, since initially Three Arch Bridge is obscured from view. Descend to Three Arch Bridge over rough grassland to cross the Corran River, then follow boggy deer tracks on the S side to the bridge. After Three Arch Bridge, follow 3.3 mile stretch of road along the Jura coastline to finish outside the Distillery.
