[![](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/ThreeShiresElevation_tn.jpg "Route profile")](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/ThreeShiresElevation.jpg) \* This race is not actually in Scotland, but is well worth crossing the border for.

The race starts with a downhill sprint on tarmac to cross the river and continues with fast running on farm track until at 3km you pass through the intake wall and suddenly hack up the hillside with a 550 metre climb to Wetherlam. This is the biggest single ascent of the race.

After Wetherlam you pick up a rocky path to the base of Prison Band which leads directly to the summit of Swirl How 802m, the highest point on the route.

The next section is confusing in mist as you contour round the western flank of Great Carr on a pathless hillside to meet the descent to the Three Shires Stone road crossing.

After the road crossing a good path leads up Pike o' Blisco, however apparently there are various options for straightening out the line if you can follow the right person.

There is a short out and back at the summit of Pike o' Blisco before starting the super confusing descent towards Blea Tarn. The problem here is that you can't see Blea Tarn or tell what you are aiming for. So best to follow someone who knows where they are going.

After crossing the road at Blea Tarn you must brace yourself for the sting in the tail, with a steep slog up Lingmoor. The path through the bracket at the start of the climb is not entirely obvious, but the fellside is clearer higher up.

Once again, after the summit of Lingmoor the route is not entirely obvious and there are a couple of route choices to reach the grassy descent and rocky zig-zags that drop you onto farm track with 1 kilometre of fast slightly downhill running to the finish.
