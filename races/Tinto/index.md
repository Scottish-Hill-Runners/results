Race Registration, parking and after race food is on the day at Damn
Delicious, Thankerton Camp Farm, Thankerton, Biggar, ML12 6PD – just
off the main road between Lanark and Biggar. Please register between
12.30 and 1.30pm (the farm is a 10 minute jog across fields to the
start – this will be marked on the day. A map showing the route to
follow).

Drivers will be directed to the farm for registration and parking, and
parking is strictly to be on the farm grounds. Runners must not park
at the Tinto public car park, or on any other roads nearby. There have
been issues with safety in previous years, and the police have
stipulated that any parking on roads, or runners crossing or walking
along the main road, will not be tolerated. Please car share where
possible.  Afters Presentation of prizes will take place back at Damn
Delicious after the race where refreshments will be available. There
will be free soup available for all runners, and Damn Delicious will
be selling a selection of burgers, rolls, cakes, tea and coffee. In an
effort to reduce plastic waste, it would be fantastic if everyone
could bring their re-usable cup (we all have one these days don’t we)
for soup, tea, etc.

Start Location: Foot of Tinto Hill, grid reference: NS 964374.

**Notes:**

* Although on good paths, the race follows an unmarked course that
  crosses ground above 2000 feet.
* In November conditions on the summit of the hill can be very
  different from conditions at the start. Competitors must have the
  following minimum kit with them at all times during the race:
  waterproof jacket with hood, waterproof overtrousers, hat, gloves,
  whistle, and map and compass suitable for navigating the
  course. This is the minimum kit requirement for this event, but you
  are responsible for carrying any additional items you consider
  necessary for your own protection given the conditions, or as the
  race organiser may dictate on the day. There will be kit checks.
* The minimum age is 16. There is no separate prize or category for
  juniors in the senior race. There is a separate Tinto Junior Hill
  Race for under 18’s, more details of which can be found below, and a
  non Carnethy organised fun run for even younger runners (see foot of
  page).
* If you retire from the race you must inform the nearest marshal and
  return your number to the race organiser before you go home.

the finish recorders and pleases the sponsor.
