The route requires runners to visit the three Eildon Hills in the
following order: Eildon Hill North; Eildon Wester Hill; and Eildon Mid
Hill.  The route will be fully marked, and we would ask that you do
not use any alternative lines in the ascent and decent of the first
hill (Eildon Hill North)

The new longer "3 Hills" route was established in 2013. Before 2013, the race
only visited the two main 400m hills.
