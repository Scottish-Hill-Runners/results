The Bennachie Hill Race is firmly established in the calendar as one
of the most popular races in North-East Scotland among hill and road
runners alike. At around 8.2 miles in length and with a total of
1600ft of ascent (13.1km and 500m), the race is an achievable
challenge for everyone. The route is all off-road, and good trail
shoes are recommended.

The Bennachie Hill Race starts at the Back O’Bennachie car park near
Insch and takes in many of the famous ‘tops’ of Bennachie, including
Oxen Craig, Craigshannoch and Mither Tap itself.  The route returns to
the start via the famous ‘Maiden’s Causeway’, past Hosie’s Well and
Nursery Cottage. Please note that the route may be subject to change
due to forestry work.

In addition to the main (Senior) Hill Race, there is also a Junior
Hill Race for runners aged 13–17, which is approximately 5k (3.1miles)
in length and features 150m (500ft) of ascent.

**TRANSFERS AND WAITING LIST**

If the 2023 Bennachie Hill Race reaches capacity before entries close,
a limited waiting list – to be deployed on a first-come first-served
basis in the case of pre-event withdrawals – will be opened.

Runners may transfer their entries to another runner themselves via
Entry Central until Sunday, October 22, 2023. After that point,
runners unable to attend the race are asked to notify the club
Secretary so that the place may be reassigned to someone on the
waiting list. Runners whose places are thus reassigned will not be
refunded.

The 33rd Bennachie Hill Race is organised by the Garioch Roadrunners
and is a scottishathletics licensed event (no. TBC) held under UK
Athletics rules.

Thanks to Craigdon Mountain Sports for their generous sponsorship of the event.
