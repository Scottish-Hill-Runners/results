Taynuilt is home to a thriving traditional highland games with the usual dancing, piping, track and heavy athletic events; so a good day out for all.

The Taynuilt Games Hill Race course leaves the Games Field to cross the River Nant and heads through the historic part of Taynuilt passing the Bonawe Iron Foundry and through Bonawe House before heading across the Awe Swing Bridge to Inverawe Estate. Up through the fish ponds and into Inverawe Forest. The climb is short and steep on open hill to Barran Dubh from which there are great views back over Taynuilt and Loch Etive. Return by the same route.

**Please note:**  
The course has a range of terrain from road, track and footpaths, to**fields full of rushes**, and **very rough ungrazed hill with no path!**

Last years prize pot was £140 from Clan McIntyre and Inverawe Smokehouse. We are hoping to get the same this year. 1, 2 and 3 men and women get prizes.

Competitors gain free entry to the games.
