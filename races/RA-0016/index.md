Although a relatively short race, the route can be exposed to full winter conditions.  
Breaking the hour is the target for stronger runners.

The route divides into 2 distinct sections:

**Start to the Howe**  
The startline is something to behold. 500 runners like extras from _Braveheart_ lined up for battle, fittingly at the site of _The Battle of Roslin_. The race starts with a chaotic charge across flat(ish) marshland for the gateway to the hill. Then steep climbing up Scald Law in a heather trod where passing is awkward. Once at the summit of Scald Law you are exposed to any freezing cold northerly winds for the ridge run to South Black and the Kips. From the top of West Kip drop rapidly to pick up the trail and fast running down to the Howe.

**The Howe to the Finish**  
Once down at the Howe the route back up looks pretty daunting. Gradual climbing leads into a sheltered gully which steepens until it spits you out onto the ridge where you can see there is fair bit more climbing to reach the summit of Carnethy. Once around the huge summit cairn drop sharply onto a spur, then steeply down rough heather with buckling legs, through the gate, then gather all remaining strength for the dash back across the marsh to the finishing mound.
