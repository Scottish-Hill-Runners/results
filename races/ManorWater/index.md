An out and back to the summit of The Scrape above the tranquil Manor
Valley. Traditionally the first of a 2-race series paired with
Pentland Skyline, known as the "Man or Mouse". The race changed in
2004 to a slightly shorter route starting from the fields near
Woodhouse Farm, allowing easier access to the hill. The route is
almost entirely runnable apart from the last steep climb to The
Scrape, which reduces most runners to a walk. After the race you can
take advantage of the refreshments tent, and enjoy watching the Manor
Water Sheepdog Trials.

Entry fee: £8 online, £10 on the day (limited number available) 
 
All the info is on the website but here are a few important points.
 
Registration:

Registration takes place in the same field as the Sheepdog Trials near
the Old Manor School (NT 213 365). Note this is approximately 1 mile
up the valley from the “old” registration field. There will be signs
posted on the day.

Parking is at registration. The start is ~1 mile from registration so
make sure you have enough time to make it on foot to the start field
before 1 pm.
 
Start:

The race starts from near Woodhouse Farm (NT 212 378, on the Main
Manor Valley Road). Note this is approximately 500 m up the road from
the old start location (through the gate to Glack Hope). There is no
parking at the start. Parking is at registration. The start is ~1 mile
from registration so make sure you have enough time to make it on foot
to the start field before 1 pm.
