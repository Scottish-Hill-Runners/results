Following on from a successful debut in 2010, the Grampian Mountain Challenge is pleased to welcome runners to North East Scotland for another unique blend of harsh weather, comfort, physical challenge and mental challenge in November 2012. The same organisation team are back with new ideas to bring the classic event format to a new location, 1 hour from Aberdeen.

This event combines forest orienteering and mountain navigation/running over two days in the Deeside area, with a remote campsite. The event format will be the same in 2012 as it was in 2010.

This event involves orienteering in forest and mountain-side in pairs or solo, over two days with a remote camp in between. There will be hot food and entertainment at the camp, and you don't have to carry your tent.
