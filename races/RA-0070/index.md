**HILL SECTION - 17 miles:** Start from the Fort Augustus Abbey, turn left along B862 for approx ½ mile, then right at Ardachy road junction. Follow road for 1 mile to start of the Corrieyairack on left. NB - The initial Road section is well signed and marshaled. The pass ascent is a good 'vehicle sized' mountain track, clearly defined. There are three watering stations on the climb and a watering station check point at the summit. The descent is steep and very uneven and rocky in places. There is a water station at Melgarve Bothy and the last few miles to the 'Çhangeover Point' are on a good tarmac estate road.

**CHANGEOVER POINT - GARVA BRIDGE:** On arrival, Marshals will rapidly direct you to meet up with your bike or wheel/tyre change (your competitor number must be clearly seen for this to happen). Stewards will help you change your kit, get refreshments and get away on your bike as quickly and safely as possible. Toilets and changing facilities are available also medical teams and a 'bike doctor'! Hill Walk competitors will be checked in and directed to a bus for Kincraig finish. All baggage and kit will be transported back to Kincraig finish.

**ROAD SECTION - 26 miles:** From Garva Bridge cycle approx 6 miles on undulating single track road to the A86 at Laggan (water and toilets). Follow the A86 to Newtonmore then on into Kingussie where the route turns onto the B970, over a railway level crossing (water) and over the River Spey before heading through Insh. Turn left at Loch Insh Boathouse and cross the River Spey for the final time before the 'final brae' and welcoming finish at Kincraig Village Fete. The whole cycle route is signed and marshaled and covers fitted over cattle grids.
