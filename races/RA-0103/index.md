The bus leaves Broughton for Traquhair at 10am, with race registration at Traquhair. Strict kit-checks before the race.

1. Traquair to Glenrath**  
Starts in splendid grounds of Traquair House with a cavalry charge for the main gates. Gentle downhill tarmac takes you to a farm track leading onto open hillside. This becomes more heathery before reaching the ridge and more good running before climbing Birkscairn Hill. Next is an exciting steep heathery descent to cross Glensax Burn, before steep climbing to Hundleshope and Stob Law. Another long fast descent brings you to the first water station at Glenrath Farm.

2. Glenrath to Stobo**  
The next section is in sharp contrast and enters a forestry plantation before climbing a steep firebreak to the summit of Whitelaw Hill. More fast downhill running takes you to the next road crossing at Stobo (drinks).

3. Stobo to Broughton**  
The last section is the most demanding, starting with a long slog up a gently uphill track, then rough moorland to reach a very steep climb up Trahenna. This is where all the runners appear to be hung out to dry, and is a good place to make or lose places! The final descent to Broughton is generally accompanied with various degrees of cramp.

**John Taylor**  
The record for Two Breweries was set by [John Taylor in 1991](http://www.twobreweries.org.uk/Results_1991.pdf).  
John was an international athlete who died in 2002, aged 33, from a heart condition known as cardiomyopathy.  
The [**John Taylor Foundation**](http://www.johntaylorfoundation.org.uk/) was created to raise awareness of this condition, and to assist young athletes.
