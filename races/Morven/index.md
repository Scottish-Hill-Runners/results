An AS category hill race. Third Race of the Aberdeenshire Hill Race Series

Entry fee (pay on the day):- Adults £6, Under 18s £2.50.

The course takes a direct route up Morven above the ruined cottage of
Balhennie. It follows good tracks all the way and is marked with
flags. The initial steep section above Balhennie is avoided on the
descent by the gentler landrover track which descends diagonally NE to
Balhennie from the col below Roar Hill.
