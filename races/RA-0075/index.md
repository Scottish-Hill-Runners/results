**Please note that for environmental reasons the 2016 Half Ben Nevis Race route has been changed to avoid the 'Grassy Bank' (which is part of SSSI). Please see the revised map. The half way point has been changed. Ground to the south of the Red Burn is out of bounds, the Red Burn cannot be crossed.

The "Half Ben" race has one of the oldest records on the Scottish calendar, set by Colin Donnelly back in 1983.

Only 3 Scottish hill races have older records:

*   [Cow Hill](/RA-0076) (Ros Coates, 1980)
*   [Alva Games](/RA-0164) (Kenny Stuart, 1981)
*   [Ben Lomond](/RA-0035) (John Wild, 1983)

Kenny Stuart and John Wild (pictured left) were arguably the best two hill runners ever to compete in Scotland.
