A race of two halves.

The outward bound first half is straightforward on good surfaces. The race only begins in earnest once you turn at the Drove Road drinks station.

The return leg from the Drove Road is much tougher with rougher terrain and fatigue kicking in. The real difficulties begin just after Hare Hill, with lumpy heathery ground and sections of boggy marsh before Black Hill, followed by more rough terrain and a steep climb up Bell's Hill. From Bell's Hill to the end is much easier, following a good path on short runnable grass, but fatigue and cramp are likely to be setting in at this point.
