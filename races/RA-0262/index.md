\* Not in Scotland, but not far across the border, and a good companion race to the [Three Shires](http://www.scottishhillracing.co.uk/RaceDetails.aspx?RaceID=RA-0260) to make a weekend of it.

The race is more or less an out and back, following the final descent of the Borrowdale Fell Race, and starting in the games field for Borrowdale Shepherds Meet.

The race starts with almost a kilometre of fast flat running, before hitting the first climb of 420 metres, up through the slate quarries.

You then cross some rougher boggy ground, skirting to the right of Dalehead Tarn to pick up the constructed path up Dalehead.

Once at the summit, you don't return exactly the same way, but instead aim for the opposite end of Dalehead Tarn straight down steep grass with a few rocks.

Lower down there is option to retrace your steps through the slate quarry, or to drop below the quarry. The final section of descent is down smooth grass, before hitting the kilometre of flat running to finish.
