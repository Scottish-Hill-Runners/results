The race features three checkpoints:

1. The subsidiary summit of Caerketton Hill – NT241661

3. Allermuir Hill summit – NT227661

Runners can choose any route between these points, but must not cross
the City of Edinburgh boundary fence.

Organised by Carnethy Hill Running Club, in conjunction with The Green
Runners, the Allermuir Hill Race aims to encourage a more sustainable
approach to racing in the Scottish hills.

In an effort to reduce the impact of the race, there will be:
* No race numbers
* No course marking
* No requirement to print a race map
* No prizes
* No post-race refreshments

Most importantly, anyone involved with the race, either as a
competitor or supporter, should arrive on foot, by bicycle or by
public transport. Allermuir Hill Race is a car-free race. Safe bicycle
‘parking’ will be available at the start.

The race is free to enter. Runners may be asked to carry waterproof
full body cover for their own safety, but a final decision will be
taken on the night depending on weather conditions.
