14/06/2017 race date to be confirmed.

A micro classic. A small race with a big feel. The race climbs steeply through the forest to the prominent summit of An Sidhean. After the summit, follow a loop around some boggy tussocky ground before lauching back into the forest for the final exciting descent.

Expect midge hell.

A new course was established in 2010 to replace the [old route](http://www.scottishhillracing.co.uk/Graphics/Maps/RA-0058-old.jpg) which has disappeared beneath forestry operations.
