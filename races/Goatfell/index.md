The Goatfell Race is a classic with a bit of everything: road, trail,
rough hill track, and scrambling up steep granite boulders to reach
the dramatic summit. Then a tricky descent and fast run off to return
the same way back to Brodick.

NOTE: The 2007 route was about 2 miles shorter, and missed out the
road section from Brodick
