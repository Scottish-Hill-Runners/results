The course is a combination of road-running, cross-country, hill-running, and urban orienteering. The route is a little over 22km, with about 670 metres of ascent/descent. There are unfortunately many road-crossings, quite a few of them major roads. There are five water stations on the course; these are at or near the checkpoints.
