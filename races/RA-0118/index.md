The race crosses some wild, rough and desolate terrain, with tricky navigation in poor weather. But don't let that put you off attempting this classic long mountain race.

The Glen Clova Hill Race is sometimes also known as _Angus Munro_, not to be confused with the old _Angus Munros_ race which was a different route altogether that started at Glen Doll and took in the 7 Munros of Tom Buidhe, Tolmount, Carn an t-Sagairt Mor, Carn a'Choire Bhaidheach, Cairn Bannoch and Broad Cairn.
