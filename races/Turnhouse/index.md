The Turnhouse Hill race (5.2kms, 310 metres) is a traditional “turn up
on the day” hill race suited for all runners with hill running
experience. Although relatively short, the main ascent and descent
to/from the summit are steep so hill shoes are advised.

The race start is a few minutes jog up the road from the Flotterstone car park (NT229631).

Registration (from 6pm) is near the Pentland café at the Flotterstone
