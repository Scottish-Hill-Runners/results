The Two Breweries Hill Race was the brainchild of Frank Smith, brewer at Broughton Ales and keen fell runner, with the support of both Sir David Younger of Broughton Ales and Peter Maxwell Stuart, the twentieth Laird of Traquair. This much-loved race has been held every year since 1983 with the exception of 2001 (due to the foot and mouth outbreak), and 2020 (due to Covid). As well as bringing experienced hill runners to explore the local hills, it celebrates the beers and ales produced in the local breweries, and all those who make it to the finish line are rewarded with a bottle of ale, IPA or lager.

The race is always held on the 4th Saturday in September, starting on the lawn in front of the historic courtyard gates at Traquair House at 12 noon and finishing at Broughton Ales brewery.

The bus leaves Broughton for Traquair at 10am, with race registration
at Traquair. Strict kit-checks before the race.

1. *Traquair to Glenrath*
Starts in splendid grounds of Traquair House with a cavalry charge for
the main gates. Gentle downhill tarmac takes you to a farm track
leading onto open hillside. This becomes more heathery before reaching
the ridge and more good running before climbing Birkscairn Hill. Next
is an exciting steep heathery descent to cross Glensax Burn, before
steep climbing to Hundleshope and Stob Law. Another long fast descent
brings you to the first water station at Glenrath Farm.
1. *Glenrath to Stobo*
The next section is in sharp contrast and enters a forestry plantation
before climbing a steep firebreak to the summit of Whitelaw Hill. More
fast downhill running takes you to the next road crossing at Stobo
(drinks).
1. *Stobo to Broughton*
The last section is the most demanding, starting with a long slog up a
gently uphill track, then rough moorland to reach a very steep climb
up Trahenna. This is where all the runners appear to be hung out to
dry, and is a good place to make or lose places! The final descent to
Broughton is generally accompanied with various degrees of cramp.
