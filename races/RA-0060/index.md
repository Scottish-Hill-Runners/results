[![Race Profile](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/DurisdeerProfile_tn.jpg)](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/DurisdeerProfile.jpg) The race follows runnable grassy ridges and tracks. There is one thigh-burning steep descent just before the first road crossing. Then around the back of Steygail is pretty fast and runnable, with a steepish climb and drop over a col. After the 2nd road crossing the route climbs into a shallow valley that leads to a steep climb up Well Hill. After Well Hill there is one more climb to return to Black Hill before a fast runnable descent to the finish.
