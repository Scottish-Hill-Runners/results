**Braemar to Luibeg Burn**  
Good fast running on tarmac and trails, until you wade the Luibeg Burn

**Luibeg Burn to Pools of Dee**  
A steep climb after the burn, then much rougher underfoot and a wild setting

**Pools of Dee to Rothiemurchus Forest**  
Your first glimpse of Aviemore from the highpoint. Then a rough descent at first until you cross the main Lairig Ghru burn (get water here)

**Rothiemurchus Forest to Aviemore**  
A long tiring flog through the forest with no water stations. Make sure you have water before entering the forest. Once you hit the road at Coylumbridge, there are 2 miles to the finish opposite Aviemore Police Station
