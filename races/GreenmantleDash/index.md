A race to blow away the Hogmanay hangover and see in the New Year. The
event has a carnival atmosphere with fancy dress and junior races, and
presents a surprising array of obstacles for such a short route.

The race starts with a mass sprint from the Broughton Brewery to
hurdle a stonewall, across playing fields, hurdle fence, wade river,
negotiate marsh, cross road. Breathe. Then up through turnip fields
before hitting the base of the steepest hill. Struggle up this and
turn with juddering legs to hurtle precariously back down, and wind up
for the final dash along the road to the village hall. Then catch your
breath again.
