New for 2015, the race starts and finishes at Cambus Oâ€™May forestry car park, on north side of the A93 mid way between Dinnet and Ballater. The route is all on paths in the forest, and will be marked. The paths are generally good and make for very pleasant running. Runners will be required to have a good headtorch, and to carry full body cover, a map and compass (just in case they got lost in the woods at night in the middle of winter). A spare torch is also a really good idea.
