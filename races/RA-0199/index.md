The race starts and finishes in the picturesque town of Rothbury, and feels more like a fast cross country than a regular hill race, being almost entirely runnable apart from the short steep slog through deep heather to Simonside.

The descent from Simonside follows a hideously boggy path, then a technical rocky descent to a car park followed by easier grassy running, and a long stony track leading to the final steep foot-slapping tarmac descent to the footbridge and back into Rothbury.

Great soup and atmosphere in the Newcastle Hotel after the race!
