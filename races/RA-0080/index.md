Possibly the best, and generally the longest time-wise, of the mid-week Bog and Burn races. The race starts up a near vertical grass slope adorned with gorse bushes, before breaking onto a runnable path and a short rocky descent to a burn crossing. The ascent up the nose of The Law is largely hands on knees, with only short sections of shuffle running. The route then opens out across the grassy tops of Ben Cleuch and Andrew Gannel Hill, descending to cross Maddy Moss itself, then following the fence line round the flank of Kingseat before turning SW along a broad grassy ridge providing a great fast running descent, becoming more technical lower down. The final section of downhill is frighteningly fast and tricky before the near vertical plummet to the finish.

**Full waterproof body cover + hat & gloves must be worn/carried. Compass, map & whistle must be carried**
