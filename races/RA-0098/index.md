The most daunting hill race in Scotland, with the toughest descent.

The men's record has stood since 1984, held by Kenny Stuart (1:25:34).

The 1986 race also had a fast winning time from [Colin Donnelly](http://www.scottishhillracing.co.uk/RunnerDetails.aspx?RunnerID=R2982) (1:25:48) that has not been beaten since.
