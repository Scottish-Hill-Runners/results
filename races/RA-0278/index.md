[![](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/ToP_profile_tn.jpg "Route profile")](http://chris-upson.com/raceprofiles/ToP_profile.jpg) \* The Tour of Pendle is clearly not in Scotland, but is a good long hill race at the end of the season. You can expect to run about 10 minutes quicker than Pentland Skyline. Be warned that the second half contains most of the climbing, and that each climb is steeper than the one before.
