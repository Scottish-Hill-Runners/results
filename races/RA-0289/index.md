Not really a hill race, more of an Inter Varsity Cross Country event that may appeal to hill runners.

The women's race is one lap (approximately 3 miles). The men's race is 2 laps (6 miles).

The course is undulating and often wet, with one steep downhill on each lap. Fell or studded racing shoes are recommended, but not spikes as much of the course runs over a gravel bridle path. The races are challenging and popular with both local club runners and University Clubs from around the British Isles.

Registration is at KB House, King's Buildings (West Mains Road), from 12:00pm until 1:30pm. Changing and showering facilities are available in KB House, where there is also a bar that serves food and drink.

Start times are 2:00pm for the women's race and 2:30pm for the men's.
