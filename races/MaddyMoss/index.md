Possibly the best, and generally the longest time-wise, of the
mid-week Bog and Burn races. The race starts up a near vertical grass
slope adorned with gorse bushes, before breaking onto a runnable path
and a short rocky descent to a burn crossing. The ascent up the nose
of The Law is largely hands on knees, with only short sections of
shuffle running. The route then opens out across the grassy tops of
Ben Cleuch and Andrew Gannel Hill, descending to cross Maddy Moss
itself, then following the fence line round the flank of Kingseat
before turning SW along a broad grassy ridge providing a great fast
running descent, becoming more technical lower down. The final section
of downhill is frighteningly fast and tricky before the near vertical
plummet to the finish.
