Entry fee Â£5

A short race with a bit of everything. The route is well marked. From the playing fields, run up through ferns, across a stile, and into forest. Uphill, a sharp turn and you're out of the forest, through more ferns and onto grass covered open hillside. A couple of short steep pulls then 3 cairns are run around, before being directed downhill. Some slippy, tussocky ground and some rocky sections to try and avoid, then rejoin the path for a very quick descent.

The 2nd race of the LochTayside weekend .Registration at the Maclaren hall, Killin 9.30am to 10.30 am. The race starts in the park behind the Maclaren hall.

Race organiser details are the same as for [Meall nan Tarmachan](http://www.scottishhillracing.co.uk/RaceDetails.aspx?RaceID=RA-0246)
