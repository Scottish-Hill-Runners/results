**Note 7pm start time**

The race starts with a short section of level tarmac before heading up a scenic narrow winding trail. Then there's a tricky burn crossing, before a climb up a steep bank gains you access to the open hillside, covered with rough heather and tussocks. The summit of the hill is set back a little further than you'd expect, and once round the trig point you return the same way.
