Although a relatively short race, the route can be exposed to full
winter conditions.  Breaking the hour is the target for stronger
runners.

The route divides into 2 distinct sections:

**Start to the Howe**

The startline is something to behold. 500 runners like extras from
_Braveheart_ lined up for battle, fittingly at the site of _The Battle
of Roslin_. The race starts with a chaotic charge across flat(ish)
marshland for the gateway to the hill. Then steep climbing up Scald
Law in a heather trod where passing is awkward. Once at the summit of
Scald Law you are exposed to any freezing cold northerly winds for the
ridge run to South Black and the Kips. From the top of West Kip drop
rapidly to pick up the trail and fast running down to the Howe.

**The Howe to the Finish**

Once down at the Howe the route back up looks pretty daunting. Gradual
climbing leads into a sheltered gully which steepens until it spits
you out onto the ridge where you can see there is fair bit more
climbing to reach the summit of Carnethy. Once around the huge summit
cairn drop sharply onto a spur, then steeply down rough heather with
buckling legs, through the gate, then gather all remaining strength
for the dash back across the marsh to the finishing mound.

**Entry**

Entry is online only and subject to a ballot for places as it’s
usually over-subscribed. If you are not selected in the ballot we will
guarantee you a place next year if you volunteer to help this year
(it’s a great way to put something back into the sport). Entries
operate according to the following process and timetable:

* Jan 7th-13th – register to be part of the ballot via SiEntries and
  they will send you an email by way of acknowledgement (check spam
  filters etc); no limit on numbers; no payment details taken.
* Jan 14th-15th – race committee selects 610 runners from the ballot
  (same number as previous years), and these people receive emails
  inviting them to secure their place and pay via SiEntries (check
  spam filter etc)
* Jan 16th-20th – runners secure their place and make £17.50 payment
  online (if you will not be around at this time then ask a friend to
  enter for you). You will receive a confirmation email (check spam
  filters etc), plus you will be listed on the entry list on
  SiEntries, if neither of these are present then you DO NOT have a
  place
* Jan 23rd onwards – if any of the 610 places remain unfilled then
  these will be emailed out to a second round of invitees, with a new
  payment deadline, and the process will repeat in the following days
  until all 610 spaces are full. The aim is by 28th Jan all places
  will be allocated, confirmed and paid.

**£250 cash prize now available for breaking either of the course
records** (in addition to existing prizes)
