Entry is on the night only at [No. 5 Inn](http://www.no5alva.co.uk/) at Alva. Entries open 6pm; last entry 6.45pm.

Entry fee is Â£6.

Mid-winter night time race by headtorch.

The following rules apply:  
Over 18s only  
All runners must wear or carry: a headtorch; waterproof coat and trousers; hat and gloves; compass and whistle; mobile phone  
No kit = no entry. REMEMBER YOUR HEADTORCH!

The route will be marked reasonably well by hill running standards; but remember it will be dark so you will need your wits about you. You must follow the marked route at all times.

Limited prizes (first 3 men, first 3 women).
