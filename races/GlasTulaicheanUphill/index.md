Uphill only route to the summit of Glas Tulaichean (1051m) on good
double track with a few stream crossings & last few hundred meters to
the top on open hill. A land rover will take a bag to the top for each
competitor so when you reach the finish you can collect your warm
clothes etc, pause to enjoy the spectacular views (on a clear day!) &
jog back down for post-race tea & prize-giving.

You must carry or wear full waterproof body cover including hat &
gloves (depending on weather this may be transported to the summit for
you) and entries are restricted to over 17s. Registration will close
promptly at 1:20pm to allow time to transport your gear to the summit.

Prizes: Male/Female 1st, 2nd, 3rd / 1st V40 / 1st V50 / 1st V60 / 1st
V70 / 1st team (3 to count).

If you can, please bring your own cup for post-race drinks to help
reduce plastic waste.

£6 entry (£8 for non-SAL members), 2pm start, entries from 12 noon but
closing 1:20pm as usual to allow time to transport gear to the top.

appreciated but there will also be entry on the day.  More details at

There's also the Glas T Toe Tickle for the younger ones at 2:30.

Note that the **2015 race** was on an up and down course with approx. 500m ascent, due to poor weather.
