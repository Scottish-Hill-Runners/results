Registration, prize giving (don’t do it for the prizes…) and
refreshments (bring some cash) at Tarland Tearooms (formally Angie’s
Cafe) in Tarland Square. The original Knockargety race route is still
buried under fallen trees so following last year’s surprisingly
popular route we will do three loops of the mountina bike trails, this
time with a different descent each time. The race will start at the
trails car park. Expect berms, drop/offs, implausible rocky bits etc
etc.

Runners will be required to have a good headtorch, and to carry full
body cover, a map and compass (just in case they get lost in the woods
at night in the middle of winter). A spare torch is also a really good
idea.

If you think you will be coming to the race it would be very helpful
if you could register in advance here:
[register](https://www.webscorer.com/register?raceid=297333).  This is
free and does not imply any commitment, but will speed up the
registration process and give us and the cafe some idea of how many
runners there are likely to be. Pay when you collect your number.
