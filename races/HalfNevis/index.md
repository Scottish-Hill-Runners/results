of SSSI). Please see the revised map. The half way point has been
changed. Ground to the south of the Red Burn is out of bounds, the Red

The "Half Ben" race has one of the oldest records on the Scottish
calendar, set by Colin Donnelly back in 1983.

Only 3 Scottish hill races have older records:

*   [Cow Hill](CowHill) (Ros Coates, 1980)
*   [Alva Games](Alva) (Kenny Stuart, 1981)
*   [Ben Lomond](BenLomond) (John Wild, 1983)

Kenny Stuart and John Wild (pictured left) were arguably the best two
hill runners ever to compete in Scotland.
