The Lairig Ghru is a category C Long Hill Race run over 43km between
the police stations of Braemar and Aviemore. This classic race takes
place in a spectacular setting and follows an historic drove road
rising to 835m between some of the highest peaks in Britain.

A significant proportion of the race fees are donated to the Cairngorm
Mountain Rescue Team, therefore any additional donations are much
appreciated.

**Braemar to Luibeg Burn**
Good fast running on tarmac and trails, until you wade the Luibeg Burn.

**Luibeg Burn to Pools of Dee**
A steep climb after the burn, then much rougher underfoot and a wild setting.

**Pools of Dee to Rothiemurchus Forest**
Your first glimpse of Aviemore from the highpoint. Then a rough
descent at first until you cross the main Lairig Ghru burn (get water
here).

**Rothiemurchus Forest to Aviemore**
A long tiring flog through the forest with no water stations. Make
sure you have water before entering the forest. Once you hit the road
at Coylumbridge, there are 2 miles to the finish opposite Aviemore
Police Station.
