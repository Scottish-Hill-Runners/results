# About Hunters Bog Trotters

HBT was founded in Edinburgh in 1980 as a club for runners who liked the student lifestyle, but were sadly no longer students. We train and race for the fun of it – there’s no training plans or minimum required times - and we are just as serious about our social events as our running ones. In essence, we are for runners who don’t take things too seriously.

Instantly recognisable by our iconic brown vests, we participate in cross-country, road and hill races. The club philosophy is that we've had a good race if we had the first runner, the last runner, and the most runners.

The club has a few long standing traditions and social events that might seem strange at first, but all add to the fun of being a Trotter.

You can learn more about HBT on our website, or by joining us for a pint (or three) of real ale after a run.
