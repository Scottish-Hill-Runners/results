# About Carnethy Hill Running Club

Carnethy was formed on 12th April 1983 as a refuge for the homeless! A place for all those unattached hillrunners or 
displaced hillrunners in Athletics Clubs who didn’t have a real hill running club to call home. As such, Carnethy is 
now 'home' to a wide-range of eclectic and some say eccentric individuals. With an oldest competing member in his 
eighties and a youngest, non-competing, member of a few months, we’ve quite a range of runners, raconteurs and rogues.

We are based within the rough bounds of Edinburgh, the Lothians, and the Pentland Hills; though we have members all over
Scotland and even a few from south of the border! We welcome all abilities and have had members that compete internationally
as well as those joining purely for the social side of hill running.
