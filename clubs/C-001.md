# About Westerlands CCC

Westerlands CCC was established in the late 1970s by a group of former members of the University of Glasgow Harriers. The club was originally based at the Westerlands ~~pub~~ running track in Anniesland, sadly now demolished. Initially a male-only club, women were finally admitted in 1986 [todo: check date], and today make up around 30% of club members.

The club captains are probably named Ellie or Tom (there are so many of them about), and the club is represented at the highest levels of SHR by the most capable James Callender. James is ever on hand should you need any results modified, rival's ankles twisted, or advice in tax-efficient ways to manage your race winnings.

The club can be contacted using a form on the web site, but, due to technical limitations, any complaints will need be condensed down to 2-3 pages. We strive to provide a swift response to queries, if necessary sending James over any time day or night to "sort you out".

The club aspires to be one of the best (if not _the_ best) small-to-medium hill running club in the West End of Glasgow.
